## Technical

Front-end designed with React, Javascript and vanilla CSS. Back-end designed with Express and MongoDB. On a side note, an SQL database would be more suitable for this data structure but at the time being I was learning MongoDB and would like to practice more. It was an intentional education choice :)

## Functionality

This app lets users to add sales in two categories, products and services. Small businesses such as hairdressers and barbers mostly offer both. While service sales easy to store and calculate, product sales may need different mechanics such as stock tracking. In this app when user submit a product sale it updates relevant stock in real time.
